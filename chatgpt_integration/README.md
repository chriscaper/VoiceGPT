# chatgpt_integration

Hello everyone,

I am excited to share that I have built a Flutter-based voice application with the GPT API. The application allows users to interact with the system using their voice, generating natural language responses to their queries.

Although the application performs moderately well, I have identified an area for improvement - audio transcription. While the GPT API is capable of generating natural language responses, it might not be the best option for audio transcription. Therefore, to improve the application's audio transcription capabilities, I recommend the use of the Whisper API by OpenAI.
